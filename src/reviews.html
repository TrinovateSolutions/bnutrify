              Thank you so much.. when I started diet I was close to 96kg. Today
              I'm 85.2 kg . I never thought I could lose weight in such simple
              manner in a span of just 4 months. You really played a major role
              . And the best part is I never went hungry all throughout the 4
              months . My tummy was full at the same time I lost almost 11kg.
              Now I'm very very confident in the way I carry myself . I will
              continue the diet plan in the coming months too for maintaining
              it.

              I just want to share my experience with Swathi garu. I have been
              taking her diet plan since February(with some breaks due to my
              schedule) and honestly, it is very simple and easy to follow. I’m
              a pure vegetarian, and still she gives me a diet that suits me
              perfectly. Diet chala effective ga undhi Results are really good
              ...na first month lone results vasthaii anukoledhu but you made it
              possible . <br />

              After that I stopped the diet for a while, but still she supported
              me with maintenance tips and guided. More than just a dietitian,
              she talks to you personally, explains food habits, motivates you,
              and gives you confidence and nenu definite ga recommend chesthanu.

              From the very beginning, you took the time to understand my
              lifestyle, food preferences, and health goals. Your approach is
              not about strict dieting but about sustainable and mindful eating
              habits that truly fit into daily routine. The meal plans provided
              were easy to follow, balanced, and included foods I actually
              enjoy. What stood out the most was the constant support and
              encouragement I received, whether it was checking in regularly,
              tweaking the plan based on progress, or answering any questions I
              had without hesitation. Thanks to your guidance, I’ve seen
              noticeable improvements in my energy levels, digestion, and
              overall well-being. More importantly, I’ve developed a healthier
              relationship with food. ❤️ Would recommend you to others without
              any hesitation Swathi garu 😁

              My personal feedback: I would not even call this a diet, because I
              enjoyed every meal. Infact, looked forward to them. I didn’t have
              cravings, and giving up sugar is the best thing I ever did. Of all
              the fad diets I tried over years, I am going to stick with this. I
              never thought losing my resistant fat was even an imaginable
              possibility, but your plan made it happen! I reached my set goal,
              but would like to continue because you made me ambitious now.
